My group conducts broad foundational and application-driven research in artificial intelligence (AI). We take a broad stance on AI that brings together the areas of machine learning and formal methods, in particular formal verification. We tackle problems that are inspired by autonomous systems, industrial projects, and in particular planning problems in robotics. We use methods that span deep machine learning (ML) techniques using recurrent or graph neural networks or problems captured by partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) in a data-driven context.

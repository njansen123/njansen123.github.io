Our paper <b>Safe Reinforcement Learning From Pixels Using a Stochastic Latent Representation</b> was accepted to <a href='https://iclr.cc/' target='_blank'><b>ICLR 2023</b></a>.

We propose Safe SLAC, an algorithm that uses a stochastic latent variable model combined with a safety critic to address the problem of safe reinforcement learning in realistic, high-dimensional settings.

Big congratulations to Yannick Hogewind, who did this work as part of his <a href='https://ellis.eu/' target='_blank'><b>ELLIS</b></a> fellowship within our group, supervised by Thiago!

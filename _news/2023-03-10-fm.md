I gave a keynote talk at <a href='https://fm2023.isp.uni-luebeck.de/' target='_blank'><b>FM 2023</b></a>, the 25th International Symposium on Formal Methods. I talked about our approaches to Neuro-Symbolic AI, Intelligent and Dependable Decision-Making Under Uncertainty, and the effective combination of Formal Methods, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning.
It was a lot of fun, thanks to the organizers for inviting me.

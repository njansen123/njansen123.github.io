Our paper <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14316' target='_blank'><b>Reinforcement Learning by Guided Safe Exploration</b></a> has been accepted at <a href='https://ecai2023.eu/' target='_blank'><b>ECAI 2023</b></a>. We consider the following fundamental problem: A reinforcement learning agent is usually trained (to act safely) in a controlled lab environment. So, how can you ensure safety if you are deploying your trained agent in another, potentially much richer, environment?

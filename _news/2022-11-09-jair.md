Our paper <b>Robust Control for Dynamical Systems with Non-Gaussian Noise via Formal Abstractions</b> has been accepted for the <b>Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)</b>. The publication will be part of a JAIR special issue dedicated to award winning AI papers and is a thorough extension of the distinguished AAAI paper. Congrats Thom!

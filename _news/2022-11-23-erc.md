I received a <b>Starting Grant from the European Research Council (ERC)</b> for my project <b>DEUCE: Data-Driven Verification and Learning Under Uncertainty</b>. I will work on real-world challenges to the safety of artificial intelligence and, in particular, safe reinforcement learning. The overall goal of my project is to advance the real-world deployment of reinforcement learning.
I will soon be opening multiple PhD and Postdoc positions.

Great start of 2024: 2 papers accepted at <a href='https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/' target='_blank'><b>AAAI 2024</b></a>: <b>Factored Online Planning in Many-Agent POMDPs</b> and <b>Robust Active Measuring under Model Uncertainty</b>. Big congratulations to Maris and Merlijn, two of the PhD students working on my ERC Starting grant, and our great collaboration partners.
